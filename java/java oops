1)How to break Singleton  design pattern
2)How to prevent Singleton Pattern from Reflection, Serialization and Cloning? - GeeksforGeeks

Overcome reflection issue: To overcome issue raised by reflection, enums are used because java ensures internally that enum value is instantiated only once. Since java Enums are globally accessible, they can be used for singletons. Its only drawback is that it is not flexible i.e it d

Cloneing- clone not supported
Serialization â€“ read resolve()


public singleton implements serializable,clonable{

 public static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
 private Singleton(){
 }
 public static getinstance(){
 if(null==oinsance){
 return new Singleton();
 }
  INSTANCE;

 }
override
readresolve(){
///to avoid de serialization
}

Overide
clone(){
throw clone not supported
}


Using
public enum SingletonEnum {
    INSTANCE;

    int value;

    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}

Double Checked locking pattern

Today
java singleton design pattern example
Certainly! The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in Java:

java
// Singleton Class
public class Singleton {
    // Private static instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to restrict instantiation from outside
    private Singleton() {}

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Example method
    public void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Singleton!");
    }
}

// Example Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the Singleton instance
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();

        // Call a method on the Singleton instance
        singleton.showMessage();
    }
}
Explanation:
Private Constructor: Prevents direct instantiation from outside the class.

Static Instance: Holds the single instance of the class.

Public Static Method (getInstance()): Creates the instance if it doesn't exist and returns it.

This approach is known as Lazy Initialization, where the instance is created only when it's needed. However, it is not thread-safe. For a thread-safe Singleton, you can use the synchronized keyword or implement double-checked locking.

Would you like an example of a thread-safe Singleton as well? ðŸ˜Š

Show me a thread-safe Singleton example.
Certainly! A thread-safe Singleton ensures that multiple threads accessing the getInstance()
method don't create multiple instances. Here's a double-checked locking approach to achieve thread safety:


public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    // Volatile ensures visibility of changes across threads
    private static volatile ThreadSafeSingleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private ThreadSafeSingleton() {}

    // Double-checked locking approach
    public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {  // First check (without synchronization)
            synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {  // Locking
                if (instance == null) {  // Second check (with synchronization)
                    instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Thread-safe Singleton instance!");
    }
}

// Example Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadSafeSingleton singleton = ThreadSafeSingleton.getInstance();
        singleton.showMessage();
    }
}

public class BillPughSingleton {
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private BillPughSingleton() {}

    // Inner static helper class, initialized only when getInstance() is called
    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();
    }

    // Public method to provide the Singleton instance
    public static BillPughSingleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }

    public void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Bill Pugh Singleton instance!");
    }
}

// Example Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BillPughSingleton singleton = BillPughSingleton.getInstance();
        singleton.showMessage();
    }
}



SerialVersionUID The Serialization runtime associates a version number with each Serializable class called a SerialVersionUID, which is used during Deserialization to verify that sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object which are compatible with respect to serialization. If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has different UID than that of corresponding senderâ€™s class, the Deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException.

How to Create an Immutable Class in Java with Example | Programming Mitra

3)records from java 14
Immutable- final variables, final methods, copy constructor, no setter- used for concurrent programming
where immutability makes an especially big difference is concurrency: immutable objects can safely be shared among multiple threads, whereas mutable objects must be made thread-safe via careful design and implementation - usually this is far from a trivial task.

f any backward compatability is required place it inside default method.
 it is not mandatory to override (provide body) it in the classes that are already implementing this interface.
