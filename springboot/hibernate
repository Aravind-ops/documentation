Q1)why hibernate?
1)eliminates boiler plate code
2)provides transaction management implicitly
3)Supports caching
4)provides ORM mapping
5)Throws JDBC exception or Hibernate Exception which are unchecked exceptions
Q2) Session and session factory

Session – interface to connect to database, provides crud operations[ session.save()]
SessionFactory -initialize once cache it and reuse again – one sessionfactory per database connection
SessionFactory get session
Session session=sessionfactory.getSession();
Transaction =session.getTransaction
Session,.save()
t.commit;
factory.close; session.close









Q3)Mapping in hiberate

@MappedBy is annotation to inform that association is already taken care by owner entity
@JoinBy is mapped in owner entity

1)OnetoOne mapping – straightforward one to one entity- similar to document in mongodb

2)OnetoMAny mapping keeping foreign key in a single column  similar to join

3)ManytoOne Mapping

4)ManytoMany mapping
//address_add_id - default fk column name
@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JoinColumn(name = "fk_add_id")


// for bidirectional one to one mapping
//@OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
//private Employee employee;

//unidirectional one-to-many
@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JoinColumn(name = "fk_emp_id",referencedColumnName = "emp_id")
private List<Address> address;


@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "fk_emp_id")
private Employee employee2;


@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(name = "employee_project",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "project_id")
)

@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "assignedProjects")
    private Set<Employee> employeeSet = new HashSet<>();




Q4) currentsession – close once session factory is closed – context of hibernate
Opensession – opens new session

Q5) get vs load

Laod supports lazy loading and throws exception in case of data not found
Q6)Caching
  First level cahce – associated with session object  - enabled by default
  Second level cache – disabled by – enabe using @Cahce annotation at entity – eg EHCache


Q7)ACID

Atomicity – all or nothing
Consistency- constraint check , unique key in a relational database.
Isolation- one transaction is isolated from other
Durablity- commit persists

CRUD operations
Q8)N+1 problem – lazy loading of data from the database happens when a query is made for a parent record, and then an additional query for every single child record.
1) instead of find all use @Query annotation selction from department left  join fetch p.listofemployees
2)EntityGraph


Q9)Transaction Rollback-@Transactional( rollbackFor = SQLException.class)

@Transactional(Progration.NEVER, MANDATORY, REQUIRESNEW)
@Transactional(Readonly =true) - ensure safety ,framework improves performance by skipping lock related optimization.

SQL  - index for unique constraints -n inner join matches all records between tables but only returns matching values. It is the intersection of two tables. The cross join will display all the rows of both tables.




Q10)CAP vs ACID theorom

consistency vs availability trade off in no sql

consistency -  same data is available in all node in no sql context
consistency - valid data is inserted to db in rbdms in complaince with unique , primary key constraints.



Q11) avoid index with null values , frequent updates --index internally creates a balanced tree data structure
